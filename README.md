# Darwin World Java Simulation

A simple Java implementation of a Darwinist world simulation based on David E. Goldberg's book "Genetic algorithms in search, optimization, and machine learning." In the program you can freely choose the simulation's parameters, such as the dimensions of the map, the frequency of appearance of new food, the energy of animals needed for reproduction, among others.
